# ShadowNinja
* ECE 385 Final Project by Ma Zicheng and Chen Yize
* This is a side-scroll game. We used frame buffer on OCM (on-chip memory) for screen output. 
* Due to space limatation of OCM, Shadow Ninja is of 320 * 240 resolution (stretched to 640 *480) and with 6-bit (64) color.
* The game logic is controlled by software. We only spend 8 hours on it, you can improve it by a lot if you are interested.
